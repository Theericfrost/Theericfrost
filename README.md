Full Stack Developer
Hi there! My name is Eric and I'm a full stack developer with over 3 years of experience. My hard skills include React, Next, Redux Toolkit, Recoil, SCSS, Sass, Webpack, Node, Express, MongoDB, Postgres, and Docker.

In addition to my technical expertise, I'm a quick learner and work well in a team environment. My dream is to work for Maang and contribute to their innovative projects.
